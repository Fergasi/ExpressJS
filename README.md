# ExpressJS

## Instructions:

* Create a new base route called /blogs. Copy the sampleBlogs.js file into your project and use require to import blogPosts into your file. Create a new GET route /blogs/all that returns an array of all the blog posts to the browser.

* Create and update GET routes nested under /blogs. /blogs/:blogId should return only a single blog post that matches the id field of the blog post to the blogId route param. Add query param handling to the /blogs/all route. The ?sort param should behave as follows: if ?sort=desc, the blog posts should be sorted by descending order based upon createdAt date; if ?sort=asc, the blog posts should be sorted by ascending order instead. Hint 1: Use the .sort() method to sort the blogs. Hint 2: Strings can be converted back into date objects for sorting like so: new Date("2022-03-22T10:36:37.176Z").
